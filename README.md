# Cardiovascular Disease Classification Project

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project focused on the detection of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using structured clinical data.

The aim of this project is not only to build predictive models, but also to provide a clear, well-documented, and reproducible workflow covering all key stages of a real-world classification problem, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

Special emphasis is placed on model interpretability and variable importance to support data-driven decision-making in healthcare-related applications.

## Project Scope

The project is designed as an evolving framework in which multiple classification models are implemented, compared, and interpreted. While the initial focus is on logistic regression, additional classification algorithms are progressively incorporated to evaluate their performance and trade-offs.

Key components of the project include:

- Data quality assessment and preprocessing  
- Handling implausible and inconsistent clinical measurements  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature selection and feature importance analysis  
- Logistic regression modeling and coefficient interpretation  
- Comparison with alternative classification models (e.g. ensemble methods)  
- Model evaluation using appropriate performance metrics  
- Cross-validation and model comparison  

## Models Implemented / Planned

- Logistic Regression (baseline and interpretable model)
- Ensemble methods (e.g. Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Additional classification models as appropriate

## Evaluation Strategy

Models are evaluated and compared using multiple performance metrics, such as:

- Accuracy  
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score  
- ROC-AUC  
- Cross-validation results  

The goal is to balance predictive performance with interpretability, particularly in a healthcare-related context.

## Project Status

This repository is under active development. New models, evaluation strategies, and methodological improvements are continuously added as the project evolves.

## Motivation

This project serves both as a learning exercise and as a professional portfolio piece, demonstrating best practices in applied data science, statistical modeling, and machine learning for classification problems in a healthcare context.
